    -   The ViewModel holds the appâ€™s state and communicates with the Repository for data operations.

-   **NetworkResult**: A custom wrapper class to handle API responses generically. It provides:

    -   Success data.

    -   Loading states.

    -   Error handling.

    -   Stores favorite articles locally for offline access.
